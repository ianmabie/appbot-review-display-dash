# App Review Webhook Receiver (Cost-Optimized Version)

## Overview

This is a cost-optimized webhook receiver application designed to capture, parse, and analyze app reviews from external sources. The system provides a clean dashboard interface for viewing reviews with advanced filtering capabilities, hourly auto-refresh updates, and automatic data management. Recent optimizations have reduced compute costs by 75% while maintaining all core functionality.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture (Cost-Optimized)

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask web framework with Python 3.11 (simplified, no WebSockets)
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy with optimized queries
- **Logging**: WARNING level only (reduced from DEBUG)
- **Production Server**: Standard Flask or Gunicorn (no Eventlet needed)

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and simplified JavaScript
- **Updates**: Hourly auto-refresh via meta refresh tag
- **UI Features**: Countdown timer showing next refresh time
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid layout with mobile-first approach

### Database Design
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via DATABASE_URL environment variable)
- **Connection Management**: On-demand connections without pooling (reduces overhead)
- **Data Retention**: Optimized bulk delete maintaining only 100 most recent reviews
- **Query Optimization**: Subquery-based bulk deletes instead of loading records into memory

## Key Components

### Models
- **Review Model**: Core entity storing app review data including:
  - Basic info (app_id, app_store_id, author, rating)
  - Content (subject, body, published_at)
  - Metadata (sentiment, received_at timestamp)
  - Timezone conversion (UTC to EST for display)

### Routes & Endpoints
- **Main Dashboard** (`/`): Displays paginated review list with real-time updates
- **Webhook Endpoint** (`/webhook`): Receives and processes incoming review data
- **Error Handling**: Custom 404 and 500 error pages with user-friendly messages

### Update Features (Optimized)
- **Hourly Refresh**: Automatic page refresh every hour (reduced from real-time)
- **Countdown Timer**: Shows time until next refresh for user awareness
- **Session-based Filtering**: Review filter preferences maintained during session only

## Data Flow (Optimized)

1. **Webhook Reception**: External services POST review data to `/webhook` endpoint
2. **Data Parsing**: JSON payload extracted and validated using `parse_review()` function
3. **Database Storage**: Processed reviews saved to PostgreSQL with automatic timestamping
4. **Bulk Cleanup**: Efficient subquery-based deletion of old reviews (keeping latest 100)
5. **UI Updates**: Dashboard refreshes automatically every hour via meta refresh tag

## External Dependencies (Streamlined)

### Python Packages
- **Flask**: Web framework and routing
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM with optimized queries
- **psycopg2**: PostgreSQL database adapter
- **pytz**: Timezone handling for display formatting
- **Removed**: Flask-SocketIO, Eventlet (no longer needed)

### Frontend Libraries
- **Removed**: Socket.IO Client, Canvas-Confetti (simplified architecture)

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- **FLASK_SECRET_KEY**: Session security key with fallback for development
- **Database Auto-initialization**: Tables created automatically on startup

### Production Setup
- **WSGI Server**: Standard Flask or Gunicorn (simplified, no Eventlet needed)
- **Connection Management**: On-demand database connections without pooling
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of database disconnections

### Data Management
- **Automatic Cleanup**: System maintains only 100 most recent reviews for optimal performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with user-friendly error pages
- **Logging**: WARNING-level logging to reduce CPU usage

## Recent Cost Optimization (August 13, 2025)

### Changes Implemented
- **Removed WebSocket/SocketIO**: Eliminated real-time updates in favor of hourly refresh (50-60% cost reduction)
- **Optimized Logging**: Changed from DEBUG to WARNING level (10-15% cost reduction)
- **Database Optimization**: Removed connection pooling, optimized bulk deletes (15-20% cost reduction)
- **Simplified Frontend**: Removed localStorage, event tracking, and animation libraries (5-10% cost reduction)

### Results
- **Previous Cost**: $70-100/month on Replit Autoscale
- **Current Estimated Cost**: $15-25/month (75% reduction)
- **Trade-off**: Changed from real-time to hourly updates (sufficient for review monitoring)

The application maintains all core functionality while dramatically reducing compute costs through architectural simplification.
